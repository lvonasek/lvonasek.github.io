          <h2>2017-2021: 3D Live Scanner</h2>
          <p>
            3D Live Scanner, initially launched as 3D Scanner for ARCore and originally known as OpenConstructor for Tango, is a trailblazing Android application that pioneered the mobile 3D scanning space. It was among the very first apps designed to capture detailed 3D models of interiors, exteriors, individual objects, and even faces, bringing advanced scanning technology into the hands of everyday users. By the end of 2021, the app had achieved an impressive milestone with over 500,000 installs, establishing a notable presence in the growing market of mobile spatial computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            What sets 3D Live Scanner apart is its versatile support for multiple augmented reality (AR) platforms, including Google Tango and ARCore. This multi-platform compatibility ensures that a broad spectrum of Android devices can leverage its powerful scanning capabilities, rather than being limited to specialized hardware. From early adoption on Tango-enabled devices to the widespread reach of ARCore-compatible smartphones, the app has continuously evolved to stay at the forefront of AR technology trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app enables users to effortlessly create accurate, textured 3D models that are ideal for a variety of applications, ranging from architectural visualization and interior design to virtual reality content creation and digital art. Whether you’re scanning the layout of a room, capturing the complex details of a building’s exterior, preserving a collectible, or creating realistic face scans, 3D Live Scanner provides an intuitive interface and advanced processing tools that make high-quality 3D capture accessible and practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to note that the quality of the scans can vary significantly depending on the smartphone used. Factors such as sensor precision, camera resolution, processing power, and AR hardware capabilities play a crucial role in determining the fidelity of the 3D models. Devices equipped with advanced depth sensors and optimized AR frameworks deliver more detailed and accurate scans, while older or less capable smartphones may produce less refined results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, 3D Live Scanner has been a key contributor to democratizing 3D scanning technology on mobile devices, enabling professionals and enthusiasts alike to explore the exciting possibilities of digital spatial capture. Its ongoing development reflects a commitment to leveraging the latest AR innovations to provide users with the best possible experience.

          <h2>2020: ToF Viewer / Night Vision</h2>
          <p>
            To harness the unique capabilities of the Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor, an innovative app was developed specifically for visualizing its data in real-time. This app unlocked a surprising and practical use case: functioning as a form of night vision, allowing users to see objects in low-light or dark environments by leveraging the sensor’s depth-mapping technology. On devices like the Huawei P30 Pro, this night vision effect proved effective up to approximately four meters, providing a novel and intuitive way to perceive surroundings even when traditional cameras struggled.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app quickly captured public attention during the summer of 2020, spreading rapidly across social media platforms and tech communities. Its viral nature was fueled by the unexpected but impressive capability of consumer smartphones to replicate a form of night vision without any additional hardware. Users from around the world enthusiastically downloaded and shared the app, leading to a remarkable milestone of 100,000 downloads in a very short period.
          </p>
          <p>
            This surge of interest highlighted not only the creative potential of leveraging existing smartphone sensors in new ways but also the strong community appetite for practical and innovative mobile experiences. The app served as a testament to how emerging sensor technologies, when paired with clever software development, can unlock previously unseen functionalities and delight users in surprising ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond the viral moment, this project demonstrated the power of mobile ToF sensors and set the stage for future applications in augmented reality, security, and accessibility by showcasing real-world benefits outside of traditional imaging methods.
