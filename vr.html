          <h2>2023: DolphinXR</h2>
          <p>
            Dolphin is a highly acclaimed open-source emulator that allows players to experience Nintendo GameCube and Wii games with enhanced visuals, improved performance, and a host of modern features. With support for high-definition rendering, save states, and custom controller configurations, it has become the go-to solution for preserving and enjoying Nintendo's beloved legacy titles on PC and other platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, Dolphin represented an incredibly exciting opportunity — not just to revisit classic games, but to reimagine them in Virtual Reality. The Wii's innovative motion controls were a natural fit for OpenXR-compatible VR controllers, opening the door to a whole new level of immersion. I envisioned players swinging swords, tossing bowling balls, or aiming their trusty Wii Remote — now a VR controller — in fully 3D spaces. Games like Metroid Prime 3, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, and Wii Sports had the potential to feel more real and intuitive than ever before.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began early experimentation on bringing Dolphin to standalone VR headsets, prototyping how head tracking and motion controls could be integrated to faithfully replicate — and even enhance — the original gameplay. The project showed enormous promise, and I was genuinely excited about the potential to breathe new life into these iconic titles through VR.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, despite my passion and technical progress, the road wasn’t without challenges. I encountered difficulties in establishing a collaborative relationship with the core Dolphin maintainers, which made it hard to gain the support needed to move the project forward within the official development ecosystem. Around the same time, Nintendo initiated legal action against other emulator-related projects, casting uncertainty over the future of VR and emulator integration for their platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of respect for the community and to avoid unnecessary legal risk, I made the tough decision to step away from the project. While it was disappointing to put it on hold, I still believe this concept holds incredible potential and hope the idea might be revived someday under more favorable conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even in its early stages, the work served as a proof of concept for what motion-based emulation in VR could become — an inspiring glimpse into the future of immersive retro gaming.

          <h2>2024: WinlatorXR</h2>
          <p>
            Winlator is a powerful compatibility layer that brings the Windows API ecosystem into the GNU/Linux environment, allowing users to run many Windows applications and games natively on non-Windows platforms. While often mistaken for an emulator, Winlator is not emulating hardware — instead, it translates Windows system calls into their Linux equivalents in real time, enabling seamless execution of Windows software without the need for a virtual machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the standout aspects of Winlator is its support for Oculus Touch motion controllers, offering a unique way to interact with Windows games and apps in an immersive setting. With careful input mapping, you can use the precise motion tracking of these controllers to navigate menus, control gameplay, or manipulate in-game objects — opening up new possibilities for hybrid desktop-VR experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            As part of its experimental features, Winlator includes a “pseudo VR mode,” designed to simulate basic head tracking by mapping head rotation to mouse movement. While this does not offer full 6DoF (six degrees of freedom), it creates a 3DoF-style experience that can give a sense of presence in certain games or applications — particularly those designed for first-person perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's important to note that this feature is still in an experimental phase. The pseudo VR mode does not yet offer natural motion handling, and users may experience motion sickness or disorientation due to the indirect input mapping. It's best suited for short sessions or testing purposes, and should be used with caution, especially by those new to VR or prone to simulator sickness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with these limitations, Winlator showcases a fascinating intersection of Linux, Windows compatibility, and emerging VR input paradigms, pointing toward a future where users might freely blend traditional software with immersive interfaces — all without needing to leave their open-source environment.
