          <h2>2021: Hammer 2 VR</h2>
          <p>
            Hammer 2 is an open-world shooter. As a player you can board any vehicle, tank, helicopter and use them to your advantage when fighting against a huge army of enemies. The game is designed to bring the action to your VR headset regardless of whether you are standing or sitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of the 30 levels is a unique mission bringing more and more game logic for you to enjoy. From simple missions to the ultimate rocket shootout, this is what you can expect.

          <h2>2022: Quake III Arena VR</h2>
          <p>
            It's the real deal: Quake 3 in full VR. This port brings the frantic action of Q3:Arena to Virtual Reality. Another Id-software classic brought to VR by Team Beef & Friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made several amount of contributions to the project when porting the game on Oculus Quest. Additionally, I created a version for Pico Neo 3 and Pico 4 headsets.

          <h2>2022: Playstation Portable VR emulator</h2>
          <p>
            PPSSPP can run your PSP games on your PC in full HD resolution, and play them on Android too. It can even upscale textures that would otherwise be too blurry as they were made for the small screen of the original PSP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Built by me in the PPSSPP community, this is an early prototype of a "true" VR emulator that can be installed on the Quest 2 headset. Headtracking works and the quest's wireless controllers are automatically mapped to PSP controls.
          </p>

          <h2>2023: Prey 2006 VR</h2>
          <p>
            This game is a hidden masterpiece. A wild mashup of Portal, Doom 3, Half-Life and Twilight Zone. It looks outstanding in VR.
          </p>
          <p>
            OpenXR/VrApi port based on Team Beef's Doom3Quest and glKarin's idTech4A++ Android port.

          <h2>2023: DolphinXR</h2>
          <p>
            Dolphin is an emulator for Nintendo GameCube and Wii. This was the most promising project as the Wii motion controller could map on the OpenXR controllers and could deliver immersive experience for so many games. Unfortunatelly, I did not get good relationship with the emulator maintainers and after Nintendo lawsuit against other Nintendo emulators, I gave it up on this.

          <h2>2024: WinlatorXR</h2>
          <p>
            Winlator is not an emulator, it is an integration of Windows APIs into GNU/Linux environment. Using precise Oculus Touch motion controller you can play supported Windows apps and games.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a simple "pseudo VR mode" which maps the head rotations to mouse and gives kind of 3DoF experience. That mode is experiment and might cause motion sickness.
          </p>

          <h2>Enf of 2024: I joined Team Beef</h2>
          <p>
            Team Beef is known for bringing high quality VR ports and now I am one of them. We agreed that I will work on community projects only. I somehow do not like the idea of working on commercial projects which usually brings additional stress. I like opensource and I like being recognized. I believe this is the right step.

          <h2>2025: Doom3Quest DLC update</h2>
          <p>
            Doom3Quest was originally released in 2021 and it is one of the best looking VR game on standalone headsets. It was a pleasure to add missing DLC support, more features and bring this port to OpenXR to support even more headsets.
